## pbf-compile-ts

A little tinkering on [compile.js](https://github.com/mapbox/pbf/blob/main/compile.js) from `pbf`, to support [Pbf](https://github.com/mapbox/pbf?tab=readme-ov-file#proto-schema-to-javascript) command compiles to typescript.

It would be better to use Babel to generate ASTs and then output code with Prettier. I'll try that approach if I have more time on this.
